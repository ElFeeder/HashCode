Ok, so basically you have a room with people on it. You have to order pizza for them.
You must optimize your order so that, given the number of slices in each pizza, your
final order doesn't have more slices than people.

Input:
Number of maximum pizza slices to order / Number of different types of pizza
Number of slices in each pizza (pizza 0, pizza 1, pizza 2,...)

Output: (Number of slices to order must be less or equal than number of maximum pizza slices to order)
Number of different types of pizza to order
Number of types of pizza to order(pizza 0, pizza 1, pizza 2,...)
